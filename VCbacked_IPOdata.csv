It can also be further processed using well-known chemical processes into jet fuel and feedstocks for the production of synthetic rubber, plastics and polyesters.

The Company's lead program, trabodenoson (INO-8875) is a highly selective adenosine mimetic that targets the A1 sub-receptor. Trabodenoson brings a novel and elegant mechanism of action for the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. This new approach to lowering IOP augments the natural process that healthy eyes use to allow excess fluid to drain from the eye through the trabecular meshwork, and makes trabodenoson, if ultimately approved by health authorities worldwide, a valuable tool that ophthalmologist can use alone or in conjunction with any of the available medicines for glaucoma. The candidate has completed a Phase 1 and Phase2 clinical trials in patients and is currently being evaluated in a multiple-dose late Phase 2 trial. In the completed clinical trials, trabodenoson was well tolerated and was shown to significantly reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.",BIOSTART;Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec;Care Capital;Devon Park Bioventures;EDBI;Hercules Capital;Horizon Technology Finance Management;MedImmune Ventures;Meditor Capital Management;Mitsubishi Corporation Life Sciences Ventures;Pitango Venture Capital;Public;Rho Ventures,143.9,Healthcare,Drug Development,,United States,Massachusetts,Lexington,781-676-2100,info@inotekcorp.com,Yes,IPO,2015/02/18,Debt,2013/09/27,7,Debt,Horizon Technology Finance Management,95.26,95.26,,,North America,,BIO 2016;Pharma Startups;Eye Health,,,,,,,
