Final project for Data Bootcamp 2019

This project was completed by **Motoi Oyane** in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB 0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with qutation marks), or paraphrasing thereof- has been fully and appropriately refereced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a difference semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbiden.

I acknowledged that a failure to abide by NYU STern Hnor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.
